1. Am I eligible to receive a **Le**arning **a**nd **D**evelopment **A**ward (LeaDA)?

To make sure we will keep you on the loop, you can begin by filling [this questionnaire]() about which workshops(s) you would like to contribute. All invited contributors to the series are eligible to receive a Learning and Development Award!

4. How can I contribute by instructing a workshop?

> Workshops are currently instructed during the Fall and during the Winter.
