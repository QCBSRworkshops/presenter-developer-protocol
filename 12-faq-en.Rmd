#### **Award eligibility and contributing to the series** {-}

1. Am I eligible to receive a **Le**arning **a**nd **D**evelopment **A**ward (LeaDA)?

2. I am a postdoctoral fellow from McGill University. Why am I ineligible for a **Le**arning **a**nd **D**evelopment **A**ward (LeaDA)?

> Unfortunately, because of institutional and contractual limitations, the QCBS is being prevented from offering awards to McGill postdoctoral fellows.

We regularly send messages and make [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/csbq.qcbs/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/Csbq_qcbs_stu) posts inviting developers to think critically and apply improvements to the workshop. To make sure we will keep you on the loop, you can begin by filling [this questionnaire]() about which workshops(s) you would like to contribute. All invited contributors to the series are eligible to receive a Learning and Development Award!

4. How can I contribute by instructing a workshop?

#### **Pre-Workshop Questions** {-}

1. What do I need to prepare for the workshop?

> You must take your time to carefully read and apply the guidelines within the [Preparation section](#preparation-en).

If you have any questions or recommendations, please [contact the coordinators]().

2. When instructing workshops, do we have to stick to the workshop material?

> *Yes* and *no*. You may replace the workshop material (presentation and book) that we provide for you by an independent option. However, if time allows, feel free to recommend and use additional tools, show additional information. If you believe that the workshops could be improved and benefit from any additional material, please create an issue in their corresponding Github repositories!

3. I have never instructed an online workshop. Where should I begin?



4. Can I invite my friend or my colleague to participate in a workshop?

2. How much is the award I am going to receive?

In September 2021, the Learning and Development Award amounts to $150 for each contribution from instructors or developers of the R Workshop Series.
