# Receiving your award {#payment-en}

Workshop presenters and developers receive a **Learning and Development Award** from the **Québec Centre for Biodiversity Science (QCBS)** *[excluding McGill Postdoctoral Fellows, see below]*. The way your award is processed depends on your institution and career status:

* **McGill Graduate Students**: Your award will be processed in the form of a stipend payment. Please follow the [instructions below](#payment-en-mcgill) that are specific to McGill students.

* **Non-McGill Graduate Students** and **Non-McGill Postdoctoral Fellows**: Your award will be processed as an independent contract. Please follow the [instructions below](#payment-en-nonmcgill) that are specific to non-McGill students and postdocs.

* **McGill Postdoctoral Fellows**: Unfortunately, due to institutional contractual limitations, McGill postdoctoral fellows are *no longer eligible to receive awards from the QCBS as of 2021*. Exceptions exist if the contract with your supervisor(s) allows for it, but this is rare. Due to this change, McGill Postdocs can still contribute to the series, but only on a voluntary basis.


## McGill Graduate Students {- #payment-en-mcgill}

You must follow these steps to receive your award payment:

1. **First, complete the [presenter payment sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vu566MpuwtEoSrTpobrAPdVBmwi-AHP1lEb9lhv0Uc8/edit?usp=sharing) and/or the [developer payment sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g6FCTTRznp0YWqfLiP8tXsWZwKR0Gu6pN0L7mrwp934/edit#gid=2104246564) by filling in the requested information.** 

    * Report each workshop on a separate line if you contributed to multiple. 
    
    * For presenters: You can refer to the [compensation standards](#preparation-en) section within this protocol to know the budget allocated to your workshop. *Remember that each presenter receives a maximum award of $125 per workshop instructed*.

2. **Second, fill out a QCBS [invoice](https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops/presenter-developer-protocol/blob/master/YOURNAME_Invoice.docx?raw=true)**. 

    * You must write your *name*, *e-mail*, *phone number*, *complete address* (including postal code, city and province), *total balance* and *description of your work* (e.g., "Description: Lead presenter of workshops 1 and 2"; "Unit Cost: $ 125 per workshop"; "Total: $ 250"). 
    
    * If you presented and/or developed multiple workshops, list on them on separate lines within a single invoice form.
  
    * The "Invoice Number" will depend on how many previous invoices you have submitted. For example, if this is your first time submitting an invoice to QCBS/McGill, the invoice number is 01. If this is your fifth time submitting an invoice, your invoice number is 05. **It is very important that every invoice you submit has a unique invoice number, otherwise your payment could experience major delays.**
