# Preparation {#preparation-en}

Being a presenter for the QCBS R Workshop Series requires preparation and proactive communication with the participants registered for the workshops. Below, there is a list of points that will help you prepare for the workshops. We ask you to read them **carefully**.

## Before the workshop

### Two weeks before the workshop

1. Obtain the list of registered participants to your workshop and determine the number of presenters that can be allocated to your workshop:

Number of Participants | Number of Presenters | Payment per Presenter | Allocated funds to the workshop 
:-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------:
1 to 5 | 1 | $125 | $125
6 to 14 | 2 | $125 | $250
15 or more | 3 | $125 | $375

* **For remote workshops:** We require *at least* two presenters per workshop during remotely instructed workshops. While one instructor presents the workshop, the other presenter must act as an assistant, monitoring the chat, setting up breakout rooms, helping debug eventual issues participants may have. Both workshop instructors and assistants must answer student questions.

> *If the number of registered presenters is lower than the number of presenters that can be allocated to your workshop, do not hesitate to invite other graduate students and post-doctorate fellows (members of the QCBS) that you think could instruct the workshop with you!*

> *Note that the **maximum** payment per presenter is of 125$, per workshop instructed.*

2. Familiarize yourself with the material available within the [wiki](https://wiki.qcbs.ca/r) and the [presentation pages](#presentation-en).

  * **You must be *very* comfortable with the content and the presentation concerning the workshop as of the date of your presentation.**

  * It is **your responsibility** to become familiar with the material.

  * Use [wiki pages](https://wiki.qcbs.ca/r) and RMarkdown [presentations](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/) as reference material for your workshop. Do not hesitate to complement your knowledge with other references and material.

  * The presentations come with a *presenter mode*, which allow for presenter notes and a more dynamic instruction. Go to our "[Presenter mode](#presenter-mode)" section to learn more.

3. Read the [code of conduct](#codeofconduct-en).

4. **For remote workshops**: Familiarize yourself with Zoom before your workshop. For example, you should know: (i) how to share your screen; (ii) how to initiate and end breakout rooms; (iii) how to create and launch polls; (iv) and [what tools are available for interacting with students](https://zoom.us/docs/doc/Tips%20and%20Tricks%20for%20Teachers%20Educating%20on%20Zoom.pdf). We have provided additional detailed guidelines for these tasks [here](#zoom-guidelines).

### One week before the workshop
  
1. Obtain the most [up-to-date list]() of registered participants for your workshop.

2. Send the *standardized message* below to all participants, replacing the fields when required.

> Ideally, instructors that have their emails displayed within the [workshop schedule](https://wiki.qcbs.ca/r#horaire_schedule) will be the ones to communicate with participants first. You may change this role, if you prefer.

*  *NOTE:* Carbon-copy all your communication to the other instructors of your workshop.
*  *NOTE:* You must send the message below **at least** 7 days before the date of your presentation.
*  *NOTE:* You must **NOT** remove information from the following text.
