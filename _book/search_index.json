["preparation-en.html", "Section 7 Preparation 7.1 Before the workshop 7.2 On the day of the workshop 7.3 After the workshop", " Section 7 Preparation Being a presenter for the QCBS R Workshop Series requires preparation and proactive communication with the participants registered for the workshops. Below, there is a list of points that will help you prepare for the workshops. We ask you to carefully read them. 7.1 Before the workshop 7.1.1 Two weeks before the workshop Obtain the list of registered participants to your workshop and determine the number of presenters that can be allocated to your workshop: Number of Participants Number of Presenters Payment per Presenter Allocated funds to the workshop 1 to 5 1 $125 $125 6 to 14 2 $125 $250 15 or more 3 $125 $375 For remote workshops: We require at least two presenters per workshop during remotely instructed workshops. While one instructor presents the workshop, the other presenter must act as an assistant, monitoring the chat, setting up breakout rooms, helping debug eventual issues participants may have. Workshop instructors and assistants must answer student questions. If the number of registered presenters is lower than the number of presenters that can be allocated to your workshop, do not hesitate to invite other graduate students and post-doctorate fellows (members of the QCBS) that you think could instruct the workshop with you! Note that the maximum payment per presenter is of 125$, per workshop instructed. Familiarize yourself with the material available within the wiki and the presentation pages. You must be very comfortable with the content and the presentation concerning the workshop as of the date of your presentation. It is your responsibility to integrate be familiar with the material. Use wiki pages and RMarkdown presentations as reference material for your workshop. Do not hesitate to complement your knowledge with other references and material. The presentations come with a presenter mode, which allow for presenter notes and a more dynamic instruction. Go to our “Using the presenter mode” section to learn more. Read the code of conduct (Section 6). For remote workshops: Familiarize yourself with Zoom before your workshop. For example, you should know: (i) how to share you screen; (ii) how to initiate and end breakout rooms; (ii) and what tools are available for interacting with students. 7.1.2 One week before the workshop Obtain the most up-to-date list of registered participants for your workshop. Send the standardized message below to all participants, replacing the fields when required. Ideally, instructors that have their emails displayed within the workshop schedule are expected to be the ones to that will first communicate with participants. You may change this role, if you prefer. NOTE: Carbon-copy all your communication to the other instructors of your workshop. NOTE: You must send the message below at least 7 days before the date of your presentation. NOTE: You must NOT remove information from the following text.

["presentation-en.html", "Section 8 Presentation 8.1 Workshop structure 8.2 Workshop presenter guidelines 8.3 Workshop assistant guidelines 8.4 Contributing to these guidelines", " Section 8 Presentation The following recommendations have been written to improve the delivery of workshop content to participants. We propose guidelines based on evidence-based strategies for teaching and learning. Even though a few aspects might be basic to you, we ask you to carefully read them. 8.1 Workshop structure On average, in-person workshops last 4 hours (including eventual breaks), with some variation depending on the length of the workshop content and with its complexity. Remote workshops should run for approximately 3 hours. Workshops are being shortened to suit this new format. Usually, the instruction time is proposed to be broken into two 1.5 hour sections, with a long one-hour break in middle. Nevertheless, some workshops may benefit from a different flow, e.g. two breaks of 30 minutes instead of a long one-hour break. Each workshop should begin with a welcome and check-in block lasting around 5 minutes. In this period, workshop presenters and assistants may take attendance, tell participants how you are doing and allow participants to do the same, and give participants instructions on how to use the chat and make questions. Following the welcome and check-in block, workshop presenters should being their lecture blocks by illustrating and specifying the content of the workshop and how the lecture and pause blocks will be structured. During both remote and in-person workshop contexts, additional short breaks of 5 to 10 minutes (each) should be occasionally provided to allow participants and presenters to take a short pause and to address any outstanding questions. At the end of the workshop, presenters and assistants should thank the participants for being present, request participants to fill the feedback survey, and allow them to ask questions (if time allows). See the proposed format below for the workshop schedules: Blocks Workshop 1 Workshop 2 Workshop 3 Workshop 4 Workshop 5 Welcome and check-in 5 minutes 5 minutes 5 minutes 5 minutes 5 minutes Lecture block 85 minutes 85 minutes 85 minutes 85 minutes 55 minutes Pause 60 minutes 60 minutes 60 minutes 60 minutes 30 minutes Lecture block 85 minutes 85 minutes 85 minutes 85 minutes 85 minutes Pause Not applic. Not applic. Not applic. Not applic. 30 minutes Lecture block Not applic. Not applic. Not applic. Not applic. 55 minutes Wrap-up and exit 5 minutes 5 minutes 5 minutes 5 minutes 5 minutes 8.2 Workshop presenter guidelines Instructors should consider themselves students during the learning process, and be thoughtful on their method of delivery and communication, and how it affects student learning; Instructors must come to workshop prepared to instruct the workshop material, as well as to respond to relevant questions related to the workshop; Instructors should not only read the presentation during a workshop; Even during remote instructions, it is important that instructors maintain social presence in the learning process. Instructors should provide feedback, communicate regularly, model participation, and create an inviting tone; Online quizzes have been shown to be more effective than other online learning experiences, such as assigning homework (Ibid). Thus, be sure to allocate time and execute these quizzes whenever suggested; Stimulate collaboration whenever possible. Students engaged in a directed, social learning experience learn better, as opposed to isolated learning; When introducing yourselves, give a short summary about what you do and how do you apply the content workshop in your work. During workshops that have moderate to low attendance numbers (&lt; 8 participants), you may also allow each participant to introduce themselves in this manner. This is a great activity that can help you engage with participants, allow them to discuss between each other, and it can help you cater part of your workshop to your audience; Once every few minutes, ask participants if they have recurring questions about the content, and allow them to be addressed. Whenever asking a specific question to participants, it is a good practice to not only request volunteers, but to “point” or “name” someone to respond to your question. 8.3 Workshop assistant guidelines Whenever you take the role as an assistant during the workshops, you should: Be attentive and prepared to mute participants that inadvertently left their microphones turned on and that are making noises that are interfering with the workshop instruction; Communicate with participants through the chat with subjects related to the workshop; Respond to eventual questions that participants may publicly or privately pose within Zoom; Assist and stimulate discussion within breakout rooms; Take attendance, and reach out to non-registered participants to request them to imemdiately register to the workshop. 8.4 Contributing to these guidelines Do you have any suggestions on these guidelines? Please raise an issue and help us improve this material! "],
["developing-en.html", "Section 9 Developing 9.1 Guidelines 9.2 How to develop workshops 9.3 Other ways to contribute", " Section 9 Developing 9.1 Guidelines This guide is designed to aid developers during the creation and modification of workshop content. We want to ensure attendees can focus on the content being presented without being distracted by issues of style, grammar, punctuation and/or structure. Please read through this guide carefully before starting, and refer back to it regularly as you work. 9.1.1 Main priorities Here we have compiled a list of priorities for workshop developers. Developers would ideally accomplish all of these tasks, however if circumstances make this impossible, it is important to focus on structural changes before issues of style. Specific to adapting workshops to remote framework: Workshops should fit a new 3-hour format (including exercises and one or two breaks of five minutes). For this, you may choose to hide slides from existing workshops to fit this format. For instance, you may hide repetitive examples, non-essential slides or some of the additional advanced slides that are included at the end of the workshops. We are aware that some workshops will be more difficult to shorten than others; it is not a problem that workshops run slightly over 3 hours to guarantee accurate and complete information. (Use your judgment). DO NOT delete slides. To hide a slide for remote instruction, use the instruction: remote tag. See an example below: --- instruction: remote # Slide title: I love statistics! ### Content: Amazing! Develop new or adapt current exercises to better suit the remote workshop format and the use of breakout rooms. Exercises should be informative and engaging. Remember to leave time for students to work through exercises and ask questions. General priorities: Address existing issues submitted to GitHub. Ensure code is working correctly and that code matches workshop presentation. Continue to check this as you make changes. Ensure that French and English versions of a workshop are both updated and that the content is equivalent. Workshops should not contain spelling, grammar or punctuation errors. Ensure workshop slides are written in a consistent style, this helps with the flow of workshops and student understanding. This is especially important when working collaboratively with other developers. Whenever possible, include presenter notes to the slides you modify. You can write notes for yourself to read in the presenter mode (press the keyboard shortcut p). These notes are written under three question marks ???. See the example below: --- The content of this workshop is essential for your life. ??? _The presenter should sing this slide to the participants_. --- 9.1.2 Structural rules Do not allow the content of slides to overflow the screen. The code used to generate an outcome (figure or calculation) must correspond to the code being displayed. Use back ticks ` whenever you mention a function, an object or a package in your prose. Use three back ticks ``` to separate code chunks from prose. Pay attention to fluidity and distractions. 9.1.3 Grammar and style Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar. Avoid unnecessary abbreviations (e.g. use do not instead of don’t). Strive to be clear and concise. Avoid run-on sentences. Read over the workshop in its entirety to ensure there is good flow. Do not hesitate to ask your developing peer to review your writing. 9.1.4 Interactive exercises Workshops should be interactive and should include exercises and polls. Below, we provide a few exercise examples evidence-based learning modes and effective strategies to deliver remote workshops to participants. We recommend that you take your time and plan well when elaborating exercises. Keep the exercise goals aligned with the objectives of the workshop. Remember that everything written below ??? are notes for the presenter and thus will not appear in the presentation slide, but will appear within the presentation window. 9.1.4.1 Simple polls See below a couple of examples of two slides containing an exercise followed by their solutions. Example 1 Context: Workshop participants have just learned which functions to use to perform comparisons between dependent and independent groups, and have also been introduced to the one- and two-tailed hypothesis testing. Goal: Evaluate participant knowledge and make them more confident when selecting the appropriate two-samples test in their research. --- We are interested assessing whether we find more acromantulas in forested and shaded areas in relation to open areas. We went to the field and counted the number of individuals (variable: `abundance`) in ten randomly distributed forested and open landscapes (variable: `type_of_area`). Which of the following functions would be appropriate to test our hypothesis? 1. `t.test(type_of_area, abundance, data = acromantula_experiment, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;)`; 2. `t.test(type_of_area, abundance, data = acromantula_experiment, paired = TRUE, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;).` 3. `t.test(type_of_area, abundance, data = acromantula_experiment, alternative = &quot;one.sided&quot;)`; ??? Note: During this moment, a poll should be opened to participants. Once you obtain the response from participants, show them the correct answer. You may request that one of the participants to explain their answer. --- We are interested assessing whether we find more acromantulas in forested and shaded areas in relation to open areas. We went to the field and counted the number of individuals (variable: `abundance`) in ten randomly distributed forested and open landscapes (variable: `type_of_area`). Which of the following functions would be appropriate to test our hypothesis? 1. `t.test(type_of_area, abundance, data = acromantula_experiment, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;)`; 2. `t.test(type_of_area, abundance, data = acromantula_experiment, paired = TRUE, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;).` 3. `t.test(type_of_area, abundance, data = acromantula_experiment, alternative = &quot;one.sided&quot;) #&lt;&lt;`; ??? Note: You should clarify to the participants the distinction between two-sided and one-sided hypothesis testing (in the context of the problem). In addition to that, you should also recall the differences between dependent and independent measures (related to the `paired` argument). --- Example 2 Context: Goal: 9.1.4.2 Group exercise Working in small groups leverages the strengths of the individual group members and improves the success of the collective setting. This exercise requires participants to be randomly assigned to breakout rooms (ideally, 5 participants per breakout room) and should include an activity referring to a point of discussion. At the end of this exercise, the workshop is reconvened and one of the participants from each breakout room should report and summarise the discussion. This activity should last around 10 minute (sometimes less if very simple) and it should use information that has been provided to the students during the workshop. See below two examples of slides containing an exercise followed by its solution: Example 1 Context: This exercise should be provided to set the ground for discussions during a data visualization workshop. It does not require a strong knowledge background in data visualization from participants. Goal: Foster participants critical thinking on data visualization. --- Group discussion: Below there are three charts compiled from a visualization book (reference shown in the next slide). Open and observe the charts and discuss with your group to respond the following questions: (a) What problems do you see in each one of the charts? (b) What are the consequences of these problems you have identified? (b) What would you change in each one of them to improve their information? ### Add these images side by side. ![](https://socviz.co/assets/ch-01-chartjunk-life-expectancy.png) ![](https://socviz.co/assets/ch-01-holmes-monstrous-only.png) ![](https://socviz.co/assets/ch-01-democracy-nyt-version.png) ![](https://socviz.co/assets/ch-01-excel-3d-column-chart-values.png) ??? Note: Clearly read the exercise to the participants and show them the figures. Tell them that they should summarise their answers and then one person should report back to the discussion when the class is convened. You may allow 5 to 8 minutes for the discussion in the breakout rooms (depending on group size) as this is is a very simple example. --- Group discussion: Below there are three charts compiled from a (visualization book)[https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html]. Open and observe the charts and discuss with your group to respond the following questions: (a) What problems do you see in each one of the charts? (b) What are the consequences of these problems you have identified? (b) What would you change in each one of them to improve their information? ### Show images side-by-side ![](https://socviz.co/assets/ch-01-democracy-nyt-version.png) ![](https://socviz.co/assets/ch-01-democracy-voeten-version-2.png) ??? Note: The figures in question are not only a matter of bad taste, but have issues related to the way they convey information. In this example, the issue is not due to a difference in how the y-axis is drawn. Rather, a different measure is being shown: we are now looking at the trend in the average score, rather than the trend for the highest possible answer. --- Example 2 Include another example with a more statistical discussion. Context: Goal: --- --- --- 9.1.4.3 Individual exercise Simple individual exercises require participants to practice a bit on their own. Depending on how difficult the exercises may be, consider allocating between 5 and 10 minutes for their execution. While these exercises help participants assimilate the content, some attendees may be less driven to practice and execute them (in contrary to the group exercises). Because of this, consider include other types of exercises in addition to these ones. At the end of these exercises, the presenter should give the opportunity for one or a few participants to present and discuss their responses. Below, we can see an example for an independent exercise and its solution: Context: Participants have just been introduced to the distribution families, link functions and they have seen examples of how the glm() and manyglm() function work. Goal: Encourage participants to always observe diagnostic plots when choosing between models. --- Use `manyglm()` to estimate the responses of mite community composition to all environmental variables associated with the `mite` dataset. Which error families (gaussian, poisson or negative binomial) best fit the data? Do not forget to load the `vegan` and `mvabund` libraries, and use `data(mite)` and `data(mite.env)` to load the datasets. Tip: Remember what we have discussed about model assumptions! ??? Note: The objective of this exercise is to allow participants to independently write the models, to assign the appropriate arguments related to the distribution families and to realize they should plot the residuals against fitted values to decide on the best model. The instructor can remind participants about what both datasets include. The instructor or the assistant may help participants realize which arguments they can use by suggesting them to use the help `?` function. At the end of this exercise, invite participants to share their response and ask them how they have obtained it. --- Use `manyglm()` to estimate the responses of mite community composition to all environmental variables associated with the `mite` dataset. Which error families (gaussian, poisson or negative binomial) best fit the data? Solution: ### To be displayed inside a chunk code block: mitedat &lt;- mvabund(mite) mite.gaussian.glm &lt;- manyglm(mitedat ~ SubsDens + WatrCont + Substrate + Shrub + Topo, data = mite.env, family=&#39;gaussian&#39;) mite.poisson.glm &lt;- manyglm(mitedat ~ SubsDens + WatrCont + Substrate + Shrub + Topo, data = mite.env, family=&#39;poisson&#39;) mite.nb.glm &lt;- manyglm(mitedat ~ SubsDens + WatrCont + Substrate + Shrub + Topo, data = mite.env, family=&#39;negative.binomial&#39;) # Display diagnostic plots side-by-side: par(mfrow=c(1,3)) plot(mite.gaussian.glm) plot(mite.poisson.glm) plot(mite.nb.glm) ### End of code chunk ??? Note: Clearly show which arguments changed between the functions and what do they imply. Speak with the participants about how assumptions of distribution of residuals and predicted values still have to be met for the models to be considered valid. --- Example 2 Include another example with a more statistical discussion. Context: Goal: --- --- --- 9.2 How to develop workshops This section guides you through the process of contributing edits to QCBS R workshop presentations. 9.2.1 Getting started The QCBS R Workshops are Rmarkdown presentations created using xaringan, so the first step is to install the R package xaringan. if(!require(devtools)) install.packages(&#39;devtools&#39;) devtools::install_github(&#39;yihui/xaringan&#39;) Secondly, you need to create a local copy of the repository for the workshop you will be working on, found here. To do so, you can clone the GitHub repository on your computer. You can use the command line to do this (more details here): git clone https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop01.git # change this link depending on the workshop you&#39;re working on! If you are not comfortable with the command line, you can clone this repository using GitHub Desktop, following instructions here. Once you have cloned the repository, you are ready to begin developing! 9.2.2 GitHub workflow GitHub creates repositories with a single default branch, named dev (if you work in the command line) or master (if you work in GitHub Desktop). This is the branch you see when you visit the repository. We strongly recommend working on a new branch, which allows you to develop the workshops without affecting the main branch in the repository. Working on a separate branch means that changes are only implemented in the original content once your contributions are reviewed. This is a “safer” way to develop the workshops, particularly when multiple people are collaborating on a workshop at the same time. Create and publish a new branch. Choose a name that is explicit about what you are adding, e.g. workshop1_intro if you are working on the introduction of workshop 1. On the command line: git branch workshop1_intro # creates a new branch Github Desktop (instructions here). Switch to this branch. Make sure you are working on your new branch! On the command line: git checkout workshop1_intro # switches to this branch # Note that you can create and switch branch in a single line: git checkout -b workshop1_intro GitHub Desktop (instructions here). Make your changes, following the Guidelines listed above. Add and commit your changes. Once you are finished making changes on your branch, add and commit them to record these changes. When you commit changes, it is essential to include a commit message that briefly summarizes what you’ve done. Keep it brief but informative! On the command line: git add -A # add all your changes git commit -m &quot;fix code for plot in Challenge 1&quot; # commit your changes with a message You can also use GitHub Desktop to add changes (instructions here) and commit them (instructions here). Sync your main branch with the remote repository. It’s important to make sure your main branch is up to date before changing it. Go to back to the main branch and pull changes that were made since you last copied the repository. Pull the dev on the command line: git checkout dev # switch back to the main branch pull git # pull changes Pull the master branch on GitHub Desktop (instructions here). Merge your branch with the main branch locally. Switch back to your branch (e.g. workshop1_intro) and merge it with your local main branch. If there are conflicts, please resolve them! You can merge your branch with the dev branch using the command line: git checkout workshop1_intro # switch back to your branch git merge dev # merge the main branch with your branch Merge your branch with the master branch in GitHub Desktop (instructions here). Push your locally merged branch to the remote GitHub repository. On the command line, you can push your locally merged branch (e.g. workshop1_intro) to the remote repository like this: git push --set-upstream origin workshop1_intro # push to the remote! Push your branch (e.g. workshop1_intro) to the remote repository in GitHub Desktop (see step #4)). Open a Pull Request. Pull requests are a way to let your collaborators know about changes that you have pushed to a branch in the Github repository. Once you have opened a pull request, we can review potential changes and add follow-up commits (if needed) before your changes are merged into the main branch. To open a pull request for your branch (e.g. workshop1_intro), please follow these instructions. Assign your pull request to a reviewer (one of the R workshop coordinators). The reviewer will then review, squash, and merge your changes. Once the pull request is merged, do not forget to pull the main branch! 9.3 Other ways to contribute If you are not comfortable with GitHub, you can still help us improve the workshops! If you notice any mistakes or inconsistencies, or if you would like to make a suggestion, either in form or in content, you are invited to open an issue. You can follow these simple steps to create a new issue. "],
