["presentation-en.html", "Section 8 Presentation 8.1 Workshop structure", " Section 8 Presentation We are adding modifications to this page. We kindly ask you to come back later. The following recommendations have been written with critical thinking and with the objective to improve the delivery of the content to workshop participants. We propose guidelines based on evidence-based strategies for teaching and learning. Even though a few aspects might be basic to you, we ask you to carefully read them. 8.1 Workshop structure In average, workshops last 4 hours (including eventual breaks), with some variation depending on the length of the workshop content and with its complexity. During both remote and in-person workshop contexts, breaks of 5 to 10 minutes (each) should be provided to allow participants and presenters to take a short pause. See the proposed format below for the workshop structure: Include table. 8.1.1 Workshop presenter guidelines Instructors should consider themselves students during the learning process, and be thoughtful on their method of delivery and communication, and how it affects student learning; Instructors must come to workshop prepared to instruct the workshop material, as well as to respond to relevant questions related to the workshop; Instructors should not only read the presentation during a workshop; Even during remote instructions, it is important they maintain social presence in the learning process. Instructors should provide feedback, communicate regularly, model participation, and create an inviting tone. Online quizzes have been shown to be more effective than other online learning experiences, such as assigning homework (Ibid). Thus, be sure to allocate time and execute these quizzes whenever suggested. Estimulate collaboration whenever possible. Students engaged in a directed, social learning experience learn better, as opposed to isolated learning. Continue… 8.1.2 Workshop assistant guidelines Continue… "],
