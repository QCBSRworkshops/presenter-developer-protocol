The following recommendations have been written with critical thinking and with the objective to improve the delivery of the content to workshop participants.

We propose guidelines based on evidence-based strategies for teaching and learning. 

Even though a few aspects might be basic to you, we ask you to *carefully* read them.

## Workshop structure

In average, workshops last 4 hours (including eventual breaks), with some variation depending on the length of the workshop content and with its complexity.
