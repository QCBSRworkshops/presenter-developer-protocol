## Guidelines

Because we would like workshop participants to focus in what is being instructed and not in eventual issues with style, grammar, punctuation and structural issues, we provide this short reference guide to help developers create and modify the content of workshops.

### Structural rules

1. Do not allow the content of slides to overflow the screen.

2. The code used to generate an outcome (figure or calculation), should correspond to the code being displayed. *Include example*. 

3. Use backticks ` whenever you mention a function, an object or a package in your text.

4. Use three backticks to separate code chunks from prose.

5. *Continue...*

### Content changes 

#### Grammar and style

2. Avoid unnecessary abbreviation (e.g. prefer *do not* instead of *don't*;).

3. Avoid very long phrases.

4. *Continue...*

#### Elaborating material

1. Put yourself in the shoes of instructors and learners. Instructional clarity and intentionality are critical. *Describe relevance*.

2. Be coherent. *Describe relevance*.

3. Be consistent. *Describe relevance*.

2. Whenever elaborating material

## Exercise examples
