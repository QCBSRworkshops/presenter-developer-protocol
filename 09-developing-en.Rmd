## Guidelines

This guide is designed to aid developers during the creation and modification of workshop content. We want to ensure attendees can focus on the content being presented without being distracted by issues of style, grammar, punctuation and/or structure. Please read through this guide carefully before starting, and refer back to it regularly as you work.

### Main priorities

Here we have compiled a list of priorities for workshop developers. Developers would ideally accomplish all of these tasks, however if circumstances make this impossible, it is important to focus on structural changes before issues of style.(See below for more specific rules).

**Specific to adapting workshops to remote framework:**

1. Hide slides from existing workshops to fit the new 3 hours format, including short breaks and time for exercises (current workshop run time is about 4 hours). **Do not** delete slides. We are aware that some workshops will be more difficult to shorten than others - if workshops need to run slightly over 3 hours to guarantee accurate and complete information than that is ok (use your judgement).

2. Develop new or adapt current exercises to better suit the remote workshop format and the use of breakout rooms. Exercises should be informative and engaging. Remember to leave time for students to work through exercises and ask questions. 

**General priorities:**

3. Address existing issues submitted to GitHub.

4. Ensure code is working correctly and that code matches workshop presentation. Continue to check this as you make changes.


5. Ensure that French and English versons of a workshop are both updated and that content is equivalent.

6. Workshops should not contain spelling, grammar or punctuation errors.

7. Ensure workshop slides are written in a consistent style, this helps with the flow of workshops and student understanding. This is especially important when working collaboratively with other developers.

### Structural rules

1. Do not allow the content of slides to overflow the screen.

2. The code used to generate an outcome (figure or calculation) must correspond to the code being displayed. *Include example*. 

3. Use backticks ` whenever you mention a function, an object or a package in your text.

4. Use three backticks to separate code chunks from prose.

5. *Continue...*

### Grammar and style

1. Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar.

2. Avoid unnecessary abbreviations (e.g. use *do not* instead of *don't*).

3. Strive to be clear and concise. Avoid run-on sentences.

4. Ensure changes to content are made on both French and English versions.

5. Read over the workshop in its entirety to ensure there is good flow.

### Exercise examples

*Compile and produce examples from evidence-based learning modes and effective strategies to deliver remote workshops to participants.*


## How to develop the workshops

This section guides you through the process of contributing edits to QCBS R workshop presentations.

### Getting started with xaringan

The QCBS R Workshops are Rmarkdown presentations created using [xaringan](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html), so the first step is to install the R package `xaringan`.

```{r install-xaringan, eval=FALSE}
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('yihui/xaringan')
```

### Getting started with GitHub

Secondly, you need to create a local copy of the repository for the workshop you will be working on, found [here](https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops). To do so, you can [clone the GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) on your computer.

You can use the command line to do this (more details [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line)):

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop01.git
# change this link depending on the workshop you're working on!
```

If you are not comfortable with the command line, you can clone this repository using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), following instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop).

Once you've cloned the repository, you're ready to begin developing! 

### Workflow

GitHub creates repositories with a single default branch, named `main`. This is the one you see when you visit the repository. 

We strongly recommend working on a new branch, which allows you to make changes without affecting the main branch in the repository. This is a "safer" way to develop the workshops, particularly when multiple people are collaborating on a workshop at the same time. 

1. **Create and publish a new branch**. Choose a name that is explicit about what you are adding, such as workshop1_intro if you want to edit the introduction of workshop 1.

You can do this using the command line:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git branch workshop1_intro
```

You can also use Github Desktop ([instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches#creating-a-branch)).

2. **Switch to this branch**. Make sure you're working on your new branch!

You can do this using the command line:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git checkout workshop1_intro
# Note that you can create and switch branch in a single line: 
git checkout -b workshop1_intro
```

You can also use GitHub Desktop ([instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches#switching-between-branches)).

3. **Make your changes**, following the [Guidelines](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/presenter-developer-protocol/_book/developing-en.html#guidelines) listed above.

4. **Add and commit your changes**. Once you are finished making changes on your branch, add and commit them to record these changes. When you commit changes, it is essential to include a commit message that briefly summarizes what you've done. Keep it brief but informative!

You can do this using the command line:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git add -A 
git commit -m "fix code for plot in Challenge 1".
```

You can also use GitHub Desktop to add changes ([instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project#2-selecting-changes-to-include-in-a-commit)) and commit them ([instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project#3-write-a-commit-message-and-push-your-changes)).

5. Go back on the dev branch: git checkout dev and pull git pull just to make sure you are up to date.

6. Switch back to your branch: git checkout workshop3_intro and merge locally: git merge dev. If there are conflicts, please resolve them! When you're done, push your branch on the Github repository: git push --set-upstream origin workshop3_intro.

7. Open a Pull Request (PR).

8. Assign your PR to a reviewer (one of the 3 R workshop coordinators).

9. The reviewer will squash and merge the post once the build passed on Travis.

10. Once the PR is merged, do not forget to pull the dev branch!


## Other ways to contribute

If you are not comfortable with GitHub, you can still help us improve the workshops!

If you notice any mistakes or inconsistencies, or if you'd like to make a suggestion, either in form or in content, you're invited to open an [Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/). You can follow these simple steps to create a new [Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).
