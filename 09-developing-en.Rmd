## Guidelines

This guide is designed to aid develepors in creating and modifying workshop content. We want to ensure workshop participants can focus on the content of what is being instructed without being distracted by issues of style, grammar, punctuation and/or structure. Please read through this guide carefully before starting, and refer back to it regularly as you work.

### Structural rules

1. Do not allow the content of slides to overflow the screen.

2. The code used to generate an outcome (figure or calculation) must correspond to the code being displayed. *Include example*. 

3. Use backticks ` whenever you mention a function, an object or a package in your text.

4. Use three backticks to separate code chunks from prose.

5. *Continue...*

### Grammar and style 

1. Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar.

2. Avoid unnecessary abbreviations (e.g. use *do not* instead of *don't*).

3. Strive to be clear and concise. Avoid run-on sentences.

4. Ensure changes to content are made on both French and English versions.

5. Read over the workshop in its entirety to ensure there is good flow. This is especially important when working collaborately with other developers.

6. *Continue...*

### Elaborating material *Does this mean adding new material?*

1. Put yourself in the shoes of both presenters and students. Clarity and intention are critical. *Describe relevance*.

2. Be coherent. *Describe relevance*.

3. Be consistent. *Describe relevance*.

4. Whenever elaborating material

## Exercise examples

*Compile and produce examples from evidence-based learning modes and effective strategies to deliver remote workshops to participants.*

## Outline and Priorities *This could also be moved up?*

This list should act as an outline for developers on where to start, and how to manage their time when developing workshops. The list of tasks is ordered from highest to lowest priority. Developers would ideally accomplish all of these tasks, however if circumstances make this impossible, it is important to focus on structural changes before issues of style. 

1. Address existing issues submitted to GitHub 

2. Ensure code is working correctly and that code matches workshop presentation. Continue to check this as you make changes.

3. Ensure both French and English workshops are both updated and that content is equivalent.

4. *Add that those working on remote workshops should hide slides to make it 3h?*

5. *Continue*
