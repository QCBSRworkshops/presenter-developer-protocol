## Guidelines

This guide is designed to aid develepors in creating and modifying workshop content. We want to ensure workshop participants can focus on the content of what is being instructed without being distracted by issues of style, grammar, punctuation and/or structure. Please read through this guide carefully before starting, and refer back to it regularly as you work.

## Outline and Priorities

This list should act as an outline for developers on where begin, and how to manage their time when developing workshops. The list of tasks is ordered from highest to lowest priority. Developers would ideally accomplish all of these tasks, however if circumstances make this impossible, it is important to focus on structural changes before issues of style. 

1. Address existing issues submitted to GitHub

2. Hide slides from existing workshops to fit the new 3 hours format, including short breaks and time for exercises (currently workshop run time is about 4 hours). **Do not** delete slides. We are aware that some workshops will be more difficult to shorten than others - if workshops need to run slightly over 3 hours to guarantee accurate and complete information than that is ok (use your judgement or reach out to a Coordinator).

2. Ensure code is working correctly and that code matches workshop presentation. Continue to check this as you make changes.

3. Ensure both French and English workshops are both updated and that content is equivalent.

4. Workshops should be useful and engageing. Imagine the perspective of

### Structural rules

1. Do not allow the content of slides to overflow the screen.

2. The code used to generate an outcome (figure or calculation) must correspond to the code being displayed. *Include example*. 

3. Use backticks ` whenever you mention a function, an object or a package in your text.

4. Use three backticks to separate code chunks from prose.

5. *Continue...*

### Grammar and style 

1. Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar.

2. Avoid unnecessary abbreviations (e.g. use *do not* instead of *don't*).

3. Strive to be clear and concise. Avoid run-on sentences.

4. Ensure changes to content are made on both French and English versions.

5. Read over the workshop in its entirety to ensure there is good flow. This is especially important when working collaborately with other developers.

6. *Continue...*

### Elaborating material *Does this mean adding new material?*

1. Put yourself in the shoes of both presenters and students. Clarity and intention are critical. *Describe relevance*.

2. Be coherent. *Describe relevance*.

3. Be consistent. *Describe relevance*.

4. Whenever elaborating material

## Exercise examples

*Compile and produce examples from evidence-based learning modes and effective strategies to deliver remote workshops to participants.*
